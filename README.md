UsingAPI keys to retrieve information from the https://openweathermap.org/ database to create a 5 day weather report for any city on the earth
Contributor: Moral Meshkot
Description:This project's aim was to produce a 5-day weather app on the browser so that that user could see the weatehr report for the next 5 days in whatever city they input.
The app uses data from the https://home.openweathermap.org website via API keys. So after making an account in the website to get access to a free API key used for retrieving data on the weather, I also had to use the website's Geocoding API to get the exact geographic coordinates since for using the website we are required to use these cooredibarte instead of the name of the city.

Challenges faced: At the start I struggled to show the source I was working with in the console even after comparing my ajax calls and the ".then" promise with earlier activities in the week. I later noticed that even though I had copied the examples from the openweathermap documentation, I had to add the "https" to the beginning of my URLs for it to work.
